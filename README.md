# Pixelate
**Pixelate** is a lightweight, GPU-accelerated image processing pipeline designed to run efficiently in **Google Colab** or on local CUDA-enabled systems. It automatically downloads sample images, applies grayscale filtering, resizes them using GPU acceleration, and saves the processed outputs.
